    "The national capital [Delhi] right now is witnessing one of its worst post-monsoon seasons. Malaria and chikungunya cases are at a 6-year high, and dengue continues to haunt. According to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi [MCD], as of September 29 [2025], there were 371 malaria cases, 759 dengue cases, and 61 chikungunya cases -- a sharp rise from 237 malaria and 42 chikungunya cases reported in the same period last year [2024].\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, malaria cases have increased more than 5-fold since 2021, when only 66 cases were recorded by September. Dengue numbers, while lower than the 2701 cases reported in 2023, remain a seasonal concern for health officials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCD has meanwhile intensified its mosquito-control drive this year [2025]. Between January 1 August 23, officials inspected over one lakh [100 000] houses that were found positive for breeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly 99 000 legal notices and over 18 000 prosecutions were launched against owners of properties where mosquito breeding was found, violating civic health and sanitation bylaws. Around 8.79 lakh [879 000] houses were sprayed, and officials carried out 4588 community drives, collecting fines worth Rs 13.89 lakh [INR 1 389 000; USD 15 650]. To curb breeding, fish were released into 304 water bodies, up from 209 last year [2024].\n",
    "\n",
    "Officials say dengue numbers remain relatively low, but malaria and chikungunya cases are rising. Dengue infections, which usually spike between September and November, are currently below last year's [2024] level, officials added.\n",

Vector control through measures such as source reduction, environmental management, and personal protection is the key to reducing the mosquito population and transmission of vector-borne diseases, including dengue, chikungunya, and malaria. Integrated vector management is essential to control the vector-borne diseases.\n",
